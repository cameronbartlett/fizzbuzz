# FizzBuzz

This is a simple javascript file that goes through the coding challenge 'FizzBuzz', using the Liquid templating engine (https://shopify.github.io/liquid/). To run it you need to make sure you have Node installed on your system (https://nodejs.org/en/) and you will need Git installed (https://git-scm.com/downloads) then you need to carry out the following steps:

* Run the command ```git clone https://github.com/cameronbartlett/fizzbuzz.git``` in your command line of choice.
* Change directory to the ```fizzbuzz``` folder that was created. (```cd fizzbuzz```).
* Run the ```npm install``` to install the dependencies.
* Then type ```node ./index.js``` to run the FizzBuzz program.

By default this will do 'FizzBuzz' up to 100 however you can change this number by adding that number to the end of the command. If you want to do it to 20 for example theyn then you can run the command ```node ./index.js 20```.
